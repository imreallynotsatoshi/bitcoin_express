   * Legal Compliance:

   * 
   * "If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized – where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts – the assets may not represent an investment contract. Moreover, when the efforts of the third party are no longer a key factor for determining the enterprise’s success, material information asymmetries recede. As a network becomes truly decentralized, the ability to identify an issuer or promoter to make the requisite disclosures becomes difficult, and less meaningful."
   * 
   * "And so, when I look at Bitcoin today, I do not see a central third party whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise. The network on which Bitcoin functions is operational and appears to have been decentralized for some time, perhaps from inception. Applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to the offer and resale of Bitcoin would seem to add little value.[9] And putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. And, as with Bitcoin, applying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value."

   * Further Confirmation - The Cryptocurrency Legislative Advocacy Group - Coincenter:
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * 
   * On March 12, 2019, The cryptocurrency and blockchain legislative advocacy group Coincenter published correspondence between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Jay Clayton and representative Ted Budd. The letter explains that Clayton and the SEC’s staff analysis confirms that Ethereum and similar cryptocurrencies are not subject to securities laws.

   * Analysis - By The Block Chain Association (theblockchainassociation.org):
   * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   * 
   * Token projects can learn from the analysis Hinman applied to bitcoin and ether, with the key learning being quite simple: tokens from a network at least as decentralized as the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks were on June 14, 2018 are not securities. In this post we explore in detail the factual record and what qualities Bitcoin and Ethereum had on June 14, 2018 to understand more specifically what threshold is needed for a network to be “sufficiently decentralized.”
   * 
   * Why decentralization eliminates the need for securities regulations:
   * -------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * Securities regulations exist to reduce information asymmetries between the promoter of an investment and investors who are hoping to see a return from the investment. These regulations require expensive disclosures (and middlemen), but these disclosures are necessary because they ensure a fair marketplace. They make sense for debt or equity instruments, but not for currencies (such as the dollar, euro, or even bitcoin), nor for credits to buy software services (from gaming credits to LivePeer tokens) because there is no centralized insider information in the latter cases.
   * 
   * Consider an analogy between buying a share of Google and buying a gold future; in the first case, Larry Page has company-specific information he could trade on unfairly, while, with gold, an extremely “decentralized” market, everyone can access market information. Page, like any CEO or executive team, is sufficiently central to the success or failure of Google, whereas many participants contribute to the supply and demand for gold and thus its market price.
   * 
   * Decentralization is a theme that aligns with the Supreme Court’s Howey Test, announced in a 1946 decision that provides a framework for determining what is an “investment contract.” An investment contract is a term that is included in the definition of a security under securities laws, but itself is not defined in the law. The Howey Test highlights the reliance on the efforts of a small (that is, centralized) group of actors as one component of what qualifies as an investment contract (and therefore a security). A key part of the Howey Test is how much influence a small (that is, centralized) group of actors has on the price of the item in question — the more influence, the more likely it is that a purchase is an investment contract and therefore a security regulated by the SEC.
   * 
   * While decentralization isn’t the only component of the Howey Test, the June 14, 2018 Hinman speech blessed decentralization unequivocally as a process that ensures that tokens offered as securities in initial token sales are no longer securities once the network is sufficiently decentralized. Therefore, according to this best available SEC guidance, if a token network does not rely — or transitions to stop relying — on a small, centralized group of people, tokens on that network are not securities and, therefore, disclosure rules meant to protect investors should no longer apply. We believe this is a thoughtful and reasonable policy.
   * 
   * How decentralized is sufficiently decentralized?
   * 
   * To understand the degree of decentralization needed to be sufficiently decentralized, we must look at the state of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks as of June 14, 2018. Since the Hinman speech does not set out an exact threshold for sufficient decentralization, we aim to find it here. Of course, the standard itself possibly could be lower than this, but this helps pin down the threshold under current guidance.
   * 
   * The speech outlines a multi-factor test without fleshing out its substance or setting forth the factors that are most important. This is a common approach among regulators, and it gives the SEC flexibility to handle the unexpected and keep learning. Someone reading a list of a dozen factors might reasonably think that the SEC’s standard is scary and impossible to meet. But looking at the standard in the context of the underlying facts reveals that the SEC’s application of the standard is in fact minimal and commonsense, not restrictive.
   * 
   * As of June 14, 2018, Bitcoin and Ethereum were decentralized in many ways, but they also had considerable centralization and necessary leadership of their projects. In its simplest form, the standard seems to ask whether a token network has some basic level of functionality, whether its governance is more open and distributed than a single centrally-organized team, and whether at least some purchasers are users rather than speculators. This is the Hinman Token Standard.
   * 
   * The SEC cannot arbitrarily apply a lower standard to bitcoin and ether than it would apply to all other tokens, permitting bitcoin and ether to thrive while hobbling all subsequent projects. If the SEC deemed a token more decentralized than bitcoin and ether to be a security, it would be applying its own proposed guidance arbitrarily. The SEC is unlikely to do this, especially after publicly laying out the criteria that bitcoin and ether met.

   * "The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts."
